# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. We will use a dataset containing information on different attributes of wine samples and their corresponding quality ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 12 columns:

1. 'fixed acidity': The fixed acidity of the wine.
2. 'volatile acidity': The volatile acidity of the wine.
3. 'citric acid': The citric acid content in the wine.
4. 'residual sugar': The residual sugar content in the wine.
5. 'chlorides': The chlorides content in the wine.
6. 'free sulfur dioxide': The amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine.
7. 'total sulfur dioxide': The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine.
8. 'density': The density of the wine.
9. 'pH': The pH value of the wine.
10. 'sulphates': The amount of sulphates in the wine.
11. 'alcohol': The alcohol content in the wine.
12. 'quality': The quality rating of the wine (target variable).

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the quality of wine based on the given chemical properties. We will use machine learning algorithms to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## How to Use the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
3. The dataset should be saved as 'wine_quality_dataset.csv' in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to access the code.
5. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
